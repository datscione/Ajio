# Ajio
In this supervised machine learning task, I use the Ajio Fashion Clothing dataset, available on Kaggle, to obtain a model predicting the prices of the clothing articles. Aspects of the project include: data exploration, cleansing and analysis, feature engineering, and modeling. Within the machine learning step are: using pipelines, TFIDFVectorization, target encoding, k-fold cross validation, Grid Search CV hyperparameter tuning, and simultaneous grid search for multiple models. The decision tree model yielded the best results. However, modeling can be improved with additional information on customer demographics and more granular clothing details.
